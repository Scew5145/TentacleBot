# TentacleBot
A Discord Bot that insults you.

Installation:
-
1. Clone the Repository.
2. Add shit.
3. Ask Ignus to update the bot serverside.
4. Cry while you wait.

Commands:
-

* _!help_

'Helps'.

* _!insult_ 

Generates a random insult. Spits it at you.

* _!github_

Links to this repository.

* _!ping_ 

Spits out what the user just said. 

* _!hasfed_ [username] [region] | [username]

Grabs the user's last ranked game and spits out relevant statistics. Currently 'slightly' broken, as it doesn't work properly when the person's username has spaces. This'll be fixed by tonight, probably.
