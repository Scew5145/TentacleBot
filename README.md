# TentacleBot
A Chat Bot for discord servers, especially those focused around League of Legends

Installation:
-
1. Clone the Repository.
2. Add shit.
3. Ask Ignus to update the bot serverside.
4. Cry while you wait.

Commands:
-

* _!help_

'Helps' (Doesn't actually help. Use !github and read this instead.)

* _!insult_ 

Generates a random insult in second person. Uses the insults.json as a base. New 'categories' can't be added without changing a few lines of code, but any existing categories can have insults added without changing TentaBot.py.

* _!github_

Links to this repository.

* _!ping_ 

Spits out what the user just said. Mostly for testing purposes.

* _!hasfed_ [username], [region] | [username]

Grabs the user's last ranked game and spits out relevant statistics as an embedded object. Includes a link to the user's OP.GG profile.
Region is the region's abbreviation ['NA1', 'RU', 'KR', 'EUN1', 'EUW1', 'TR1', 'LA1', 'LA2', 'BR1', 'OC1', 'JP1']. No region is defaulted to NA1, and leaving out the number in the region name will default to server 1 (ex: LA --> LA1, NA ---> NA1, etc.)

* _!quickTest_

This is a command I personally use to test small chunks of code to make sure I understand what I'm doing. Changes frequently, and often has hard-coded IDs.
